#+TITLE: InferSent Mirror with setup.py

InferSent is not providing packaging, thus user need to download the
code and put into sys.path.

This repo simply add that for my own use. You can install it by:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
pip install --user git+https://github.com/lihebi/InferSent
#+END_EXAMPLE

or locally:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
python3 setup.py install --user
#+END_EXAMPLE

The model can be imported like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC py
from infersent.models import InferSent
#+END_SRC
